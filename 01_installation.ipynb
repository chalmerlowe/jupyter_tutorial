    "\n",

For example, virtualenvs prevent Python's `site packages` folder from getting filled with potentially conflicting versions of software AND thus prevents problems that arise when one project needs **version x.x** of a library but another project needs **version y.y** of the same library. At their core, virtualenvs are glorified directories that use scripts and metadata to organize and control the environment. You are allowed to have an essentially unlimited number of virtualenvs. And as you saw above, they are very easy to create using various command line tools, such as `conda`."
